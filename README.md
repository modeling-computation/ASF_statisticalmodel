## Abstract

African swine fever (ASF) is a disease with a high mortality rate and high transmissibility. Identifying high risk areas and understanding transmission characteristics of ASF in advance are essential for preventing their spread in a short period of time. This study investigated the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of ASF in Republic of Korea by analyzing surveillance data on wild boar carcasses. We observed a distinct annual propagation pattern, with the virus trending southward over time. Notably, the data suggest a suppression of this southward movement in 2023, potentially due to the implementation of control measures such as the installation of extensive fences in strategic areas. To analyze and predict ASF spread more accurately, we introduced a statistical model that calculates the average monthly number of carcasses by district. This enables us to identify the risk clusters, such as high-risk areas where carcass occurrences significantly exceed the average. This approach enhances our understanding of ASF spatial dynamics. Additionally, it contributes to the epidemiology and study of animal infectious diseases by highlighting areas requiring urgent and focused intervention. By providing crucial data for the targeted allocation of resources for disease management and preventive measures, our findings lay vital groundwork for improving ASF management strategies, ultimately aiding in the containment and control of this devastating disease.\\
